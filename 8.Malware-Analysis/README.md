# Malware-Analysis 

## Storyline 
In a distant galaxy, eons ago, the Cybernetic Engineers of the Galactic Cyber Alliance were tasked with constructing a digital utopia, a vast cyber world that would serve as the foundation for peace and prosperity across the stars. However, among the engineers, a disgruntled individual known only as "DarkByte" harbored a hidden agenda.

During the early days of the Cybernetic construction, DarkByte surreptitiously implanted a powerful and elusive malware, "CyberSith," into the very fabric of the Galactic Cyber World. This malware was designed to be a dormant sleeper agent, waiting for the opportune moment to wreak havoc.

Centuries later, the Cyber World has thrived, becoming a hub for communication, commerce, and collaboration among civilizations. Now, the participants of the Cyber Security CTF find themselves in a precarious situation. As nefarious attackers, they are tasked with unleashing the dormant CyberSith malware to reveal a hidden flag and prove their prowess in the dark arts of malwareÂ analysis.
